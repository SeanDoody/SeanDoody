- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SeanDoody
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking for full-time employment as an entry-level front-end developer.
- ðŸŒ± I completed Grand Circus' front-end bootcamp in March 2021 (focused on Angular). I am working on increasing my front-end knowledge, building upon the Angular skills that I already have and learning how to use React.
